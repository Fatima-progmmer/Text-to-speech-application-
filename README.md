A **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** application that converts written text into spoken words. This project allows users to input text, and with the help of speech synthesis technology, it reads the text aloud. 

## 📌 Features  
✅ **Text Input** – Enter text into a text box  
✅ **Speech Output** – Converts entered text into speech  
✅ **Voice Control** – Option to change speech rate and voice type  
✅ **Simple UI** – Clean interface with minimal design  
✅ **Mobile and Desktop Compatible** – Works seamlessly across devices

## 🚀 Technologies Used  
- **HTML5** – For the structure of the web page  
- **CSS3** – For styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** – For implementing text-to-speech functionality using the Web Speech API  
- **Web Speech API** – The key API used to convert text to speech
